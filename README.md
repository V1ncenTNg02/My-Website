# My personal website!

## Something to say...
This is the first version of my personal website. I want to showcase some interesting projects that I have done, some interesting visual effects, and something you don't know about me! Also, this is a place where I do experiments of interesting and cool visual effects, functionalities, and new design. Feel free to check it out! New elements are under development, coming soon!
